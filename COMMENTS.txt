TEST SITE : http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~hauser/teaching/Networks-F15/lectures/calendar.html

This is the GET request the client browser sends to the web server to navigate to the 455 calendar page.
When the proxy receives this, it gets the Host field and connects a new socket to the webserver at the 
host with port 80. The GET request is then sent to the web server.
    GET /~hauser/teaching/Networks-F15/lectures/calendar.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.eecs.wsu.edu

This is an HTTP response header the webserver sends back to the client browser as a result of a HEAD
request. The status code 200 in the first line shows that the GET request was successful and the server 
will return the contents of the requested document, right after the header.

from the status code 403 in the first line.

    Connection: keep-alive


This is an HTTP response header the webserver sends back to the client browser. The status code 302
in the first line indicates that the requested resource resides temporarily under a different URL. 
Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client must continue to use the that URL
for future requests.

SUMMARY
    In all the websites, all of the headers sent to and from the client browser and webservers were
    using GET and HEAD requests as well as HTTP responses. The 455 Calendar site was the only one
    to use a POST request since it was the only website I filled out a web form for to submit. The
    CNN news site was also the only one to use chunked transfer-encoding which allows for the sending
    of data before all the content has been generated for sending. It allows for a faster loading of
    the webpage and serves to ensure the user doesn't just think there's a problem when there isn't
    one since the client browser will update as the chunks are sent.
